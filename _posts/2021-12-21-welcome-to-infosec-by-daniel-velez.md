As of today, December 21st, 2021, I have 2 months of experience in cybersecurity and am about halfway through Fullstack Academy's Immersive Cyber Bootcamp, which I am grateful to be attending on a full scholarship.

At the moment, my main goals in this area of my life are:

* Mastering foundational offensive and defensive InfoSec skills
* Passing the OSCP Exam on my first try in Q1 2022
* Obtaining a job as a Cybersecurity Engineer or Penetration Tester

I'm currently making use of [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/danielvelez), [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/847595), [HTB Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com), and other resources to accomplish these specific goals.

This blog will serve as an area where I can document everything I'm learning about InfoSec.

Regarding certifications, my vision is to obtain the following and then start the job application process:

* AWS Cloud Practitioner 
* Splunk Core Certified User
* CompTIA Security+
* CompTIA PenTest+
* CompTIA Network+
* Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)

The first three are covered by my scholarship to Fullstack Academy.

In addition to everything I've mentioned, I also plan on finishing a few [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/mrdanielvelez) courses, completing Harvard's Intro to Artificial Intelligence with Python course, and continuing to write and speak about bioenergetics and other topics on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/danielvelez) and my [personal blog.](https://danielvelez.me)

Stay tuned!
